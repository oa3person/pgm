#题目一： Find and Replace Pattern
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

    Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

    You may return the answer in any order.

     

    Example 1:

    Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
    Output: ["mee","aqq"]
    Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
    "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
    since a and b map to the same letter.
     

    Note:

    1 <= words.length <= 50
    1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20

#题目二：Rotated Digits
    X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

    A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

    Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

    Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
Note:

N  will be in range [1, 10000]
